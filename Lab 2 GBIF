# Last week we looked at R's built in databases
# R can also pull from external databases
# Let's try this with GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
# The dismo library is the library we will use to access the GBIF database
# We need to install dismo before we can use it

install.packages("dismo")

#For R to pull from an online database we need jsonlite

install.packages("jsonlite")

# You only need to install a package once
# But you will need to load the library every time you start a new R session

library(dismo)
library(jsonlite)

# Let's name the dataset and plug in the genus and species names 

your_fav_animal = gbif("genus", "species")

# There's a lot of info, let's just subset what we need
# This line of code tells R the columns we want: "species" and "year". 
# And that we only want observations from the "year" column to be between your birth year and 2024

species_year = subset(your_fav_animal, select= c('species', 'year'), 
                      your_fav_animal$year >= yourbirthyear & your_fav_animal$year <= 2024)


#Now lets calculate how many observations of the species were made each year
# We can do this by counting the # of rows that have the same year in the "year" column
# ddply() is a function from the plyr library
# It allows you to group together rows of data based on variable within the dataframe

install.packages("plyr")
library(plyr)

species_count = ddply(species_year, ("year"), summarize, 
                    count = length(species))

# Now we can plot the data this time using ggplot

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Basic line plot 
ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_line()

# Basic line plot with points
ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()

# Change the line type
ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_line(linetype = "dashed")+
  geom_point()

# Change the color
ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_line(linetype = "dashed", color="pick a color")+
  geom_point()

# Add an arrow
install.packages("grid")
library(grid)

ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_line(arrow = arrow())+
  geom_point()

# Let's make some bar plots next

ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")

#Flip the X and Y axis

ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_flip()

# Change colors
ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="pick a color", fill="pick a color")

# Change barplot line colors by groups
ggplot(data=species_count, aes(x=year, y=count, color=year)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="pick a color")

#Customize your favorite plot and submit your fav on moodle
#You can save a plot by clicking "export" then "save image as"
